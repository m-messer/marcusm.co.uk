# Key Projects
## Menagerie: A Dataset of Graded CS1 Assignments

The Menagerie dataset consists of a second semester CS1 assignment that ran over four academic years (18/19 - 21/22). It consists of 667 total submissions, with 273 of those being subsequently graded post hoc as part of a study into the consistency of human graders, and includes final grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation.
